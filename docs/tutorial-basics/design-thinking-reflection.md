# Design Thinking Reflection

## Needfinding

The first step was to create a list of small problems that bugged me. Some of these included issues with my TV not connecting to my Wi-Fi, a game a play continuously crashing, and my lunch table not having enough protectiion from the sun. I actually had a kind of hard time coming up with these bugs because it was hard to think of problems I have that could have any sort of solution, but I did come up with a list of 10 to work from.
